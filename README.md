This is a repository for the paper "A Scalable and High Performance NTT Hardware Accelerator Based on Four-step NTT Algorithm for Polynomial Multiplicaton".

It will employ a Scala-based embedded language known as "SpinalHDL" to generate parametric Verilog HDL code for NTT/INTT and polynomial multiplier architectures for FPGAs based on four-step NTT algorithm.

We will make our source code available here after our paper gets accepted and the entire FHE accelerator completed.
